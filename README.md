# Employee-Tracker-CMS
Module 10

This application builds a commandline application from scratch, which helps manage a company's employee database using Node.js, the Inquirer package, and PostgreSQL.

The node-postgres package helps connect the application database to the queries, while the Inquirer package helps users interact with the charts via the terminal.
